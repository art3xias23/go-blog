Another shit film.</p><p>However, I saw Fincher and thought, thank God. Please do justice to Michael.</p><p>I was not disappointed. Well executed, music is always on par with Fincher.

I spent my whole week watching the Insidious films so that we can go and see the new "Red Door" film. On the drive there my friend said let's see this film. I told him to check the ratings on rotten tomatoes and that was it. We knew we had to change screenings.</p><p>I liked the intro one shot of a guy going through a party looking for someone. The suicide was also early on and unexpected but nothing fancy yet. </p><p>As soon as we were brought up to speed on the hand I immediately remembered It Follows and how instead of an STD and it's stigma follow you around we have the metaphor for drugs. </p><p>Mia was a good example, she had lost her mom a year ago and her dad was emotionally unavailable. She was desperate to cling onto someone. When she saw that she might be losing Jade to Daniel she opened her arms wide and welcomed the hand. Again, just trying to cling onto something.</p><p>The whole concept of the spirits was wild. A brand new, original, fresh idea. I loved every interaction and every scene. </p><p>As with most drugs despite it being scary, despite us hearing of people who have found their death or an awful consequence of drug use we still want to see it for ourselves and remember the first exhilarating moments. </p><p>Until you do too much and parts of the experience cling onto you like a bad desease. </p><p>I hated the moment when Mia was responsible for Riley and she let him do too much of the hand and he got scarred for life, mentally and physically. I hated it as it was so true and real. I also sympathise with Mia as we are given her background and you can understand how badly she needed her Mom and some closure or clarity.</p><p>Throughout the film I got attached to these characters and really cared for them. </p><p>Most shocking part was when Mia did the hand and a little girl showed up. Then out of no where the girl says "I let you in" WHAT??? HAD NO IDEA IT WENT BOTH WAYS.</p><p>And of course the ending was brutal and perfect. Mia is quickly taken through scenes at the hospital of Riley being rushed back talking to his family and leaving with them. We then see her father, who possibly was not her father, but just the spirits leading Mia to the place where these trapped spirits go. Once the light showed up I knew what was going to happen, but the moment the Spanish guy says "I let you in" that also blew my mind as I wanted to see what that perspective was like.</p><p>Overall I felt like I wanted to see more of thr spirits, their realm and their point of view, nevertheless we were shown just enough to be mesmerised, interested. The rest was done by our imagination and that was plenty for me to love the story and not be disappointed by a single thing thejq directors did. </p><p>Also when I found out this is a first feature for the directors and that they were youtubers u was left even more impressed.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>
		
			<item> <title>Oppenheimer, 2023 - ★★★★</title> <link>https://letterboxd.com/art3xias/film/oppenheimer-2023/</link> <guid isPermaLink="false">letterboxd-review-425168320</guid> <pubDate>Fri, 4 Aug 2023 13:22:39 +1200</pubDate> <letterboxd:watchedDate>2023-08-04</letterboxd:watchedDate> <letterboxd:rewatch>No</letterboxd:rewatch> <letterboxd:filmTitle>Oppenheimer</letterboxd:filmTitle> <letterboxd:filmYear>2023</letterboxd:filmYear> <letterboxd:memberRating>4.0</letterboxd:memberRating> <tmdb:movieId>872585</tmdb:movieId> <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/4/3/2/8/784328-oppenheimer-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=e3c6e7a32c"/></p> <p>I dont think it's possible to cover even the slightest of this film without going on a wide tangent.</p><p>Its funny how The Manhattan project was actually mentioned at the end of Tenet. The part mentioned is about how before testing The Gadget (The test bomb) Openheimer becomes excessively concerned they might cause a chain reaction which destroys the world.</p><p>It's also nice that Nolan relied on Kip Thorne to advise on this film again after Kip was the mastermind behind the visualisation of thr black hole in interstellar. </p><p>I also liked how Nolan changed the story of Openheimer poisoning the apple. In reality Openheimer poisoned it again, however then he went on vacation and told one of his buddies. Was later expelled and his teacher by chance did not eat the apple, where as in the film Nolan saves Bohr, because of a wormhole. (Get it? Worm - hole?)</p><p>I enjoyed all the small details which were mentioned. Examples include how Hitler despised Jews and disregarded Jewish science. How the bomb was not dropped on Kyoto as the secretary Henry Stinson had honeymooned there.</p><p>I also liked how the film starts with droplets of rain which cause ripples on the water. The Bhagavat Gitta also makes mentions of such droplets. Furthermore, we also see images of explosions, blasting fire which again fall I to the idea of a devastating chain reaction. We also see static background in multiple scenes where Oppie's psyche begins to shatter due the aforementioned idea.</p><p>I liked how Oppie and Straus' viewpoints were split. Oppie's moments were colorful and vibrant. Strauss' were bland in black and white, possibly showing how he views the word 2 - dimensionally and isn't able to perceive the intricacies of his world.</p><p>Loved how Jean was shown and the impact she had on Oppie, making him read sanscrit and the key phrase of "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds". Also at one time there was a book shown that Oppie read which was a poem given to him by Jene. She had a profound affect on his life.</p><p>Another cool moment was how hands in black gloves where shown drowning Jean, thus indicating that someone could have murdered her. This plays well as it brings in the conspiracies surrounding her death. One such conspiracy is that the CIA murdered her in order to help Oppie focus and prevent a communist obtaining valuable scientific information.</p><p>I'll mention one last thing. </p><p>I loved the bomb moment, how there's complete silence before the sound wave hits us. We can only hear Oppie breathing and mentoning the key Sanscrit words.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

Probably enjoyed it a lot more than when I saw it as a teenager. </p><p>A timeless classic.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

It's been a well established idea by now and the creators felt comfortable in it, too comfortable even. </p><p>However, by far the best part in the film were all the characters and moments from Elsie's past. Her whole story has been told and I fear this will be the last time we will see her. </p><p>No matter, a great character in Elise and also a decent horror film in my book.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

We saw Elise as the protagonist, a feat the character really deserved.</p><p>We saw the introduction of Elsie's team and how they got together. Also we saw where the Lady who is gunning for Elise came from. Thus making a notable contribution to the overall story. </p><p>The film by itself saw many new characters and I was scared and interested through a big chunk of the film.

The story was touching, truly incredible. Starlord going through a difficult time and having to pick himself up to save his friend. The arrow guy finally learning how to use it. Gamora warming up to Starlord. Everyone going their separate way in the end. It's a beautifully setup and executed story. Like taken from a child's book. That's a good thing. Combined with all the adult struggle themes you end up with a masterpiece for the 3rd installment.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

There was always a bad directional or editorial thing poking my eyes out. </p><p>The only thing which was decent were the actors. They did an okay job. </p><p>The editing was awful and all over the place. Some scenes were just left unfinished in the middle of the action. </p><p>Some ghost scenes were unnecessary. </p><p>Some character desicions were unreasonable and didnt make any sense. </p><p>Also, I see this as a trip after a psychedelic. I want to be by myself, think it through. But nooo, let's all go to a party and get smashed, not even thinking we've got exams in 10 days.</p><p>I swear to god one scene where one of the female leads opens the door to a room, the room is just a photoshopped photo.</p><p>On the escalator when the same student apologised to her high-school classmate, her classmate was crying obviously distraught, 2 seconds later she is okay, fully relaxed smiling back and everything is okay?

Enjoyed it thoroughly.</p><p>Gawain is a boy who lives at home, drinks regularly and bears no reaponaibility to his lover or his life. He views the knights at king Arthur's court as legends and wants the same fame and glory for himself.</p><p>As the green knight offers him am easy way to achieve all of his desires easily Gawain takes the chance without hesitating, however nothing in life comes easy and if you are willing to seek glory you should be contempt with the fate of death. </p><p>Why is the green knight green? He is green because he symbolises the cycle of life and death. Green pastures or rot. It's an inevitable cycle that all of us should accept.</p><p>Gawain is accompanied by a fox on his quest, a quest he doesn't understand until the end. The fox is seen as a cunning thief symbolizing Gawain's attitude. It could also symbolize his mother. Protector from giants and protector from his encounter with the green knight. When the fox is not present we see the woman with the blindfold, just as his mother was at the start of the film.</p><p>Gawain takes the green girdle for protection, which symbolically is covered in his semen. He was not able to withstand temptetation, thus he was called "No knight" by the lady. Undeserving of honor and wishfully carrying a boyish girlde to protect him from harm.</p><p>As Gawain is ready to meet the green knight he sends the fox away as he is a step closer to facing his fear and does not listen to the fox muttering out his desire to go home, not bearing responsibility for chopping of the knight's head.</p><p>As they meet and the knight is about to return the blow we see an alternative view of what would have happened if Gawain was to retreat. He would have had a tyrannical rule, which would have ended in a loss of his kingdom, lover and child. </p><p>As Gawain realises that he will always succumb to death and that a spoiled, unworthy life is not the correct choice, he removes the girdle and prepares to face his fate, no matter what it could be. He is ready. </p><p>In the end, it's not important if the knight chops off his head or not. It's important that Gawain has accepted death and is ready to live life standing strong and taking responsibility.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

It was encapsulating, entertaining, extremely well shot and acted.</p><p>It's a bit strange as we cannot tell if this is a real world.</p><p>Everything that is happening is from the perspective of Beau Wasserman. It's a stressed and anxious world that he lives in and we experience it with him. All the current issues in the US: gun violence, homelessness, police helplessness can be seen as true worries of the main protagonist. </p><p>All that stress is coming from his relationship with his Mother. He buys frozen food which is produced by Mona Wasserman due to the MW logo. The microwave has the MW logo. As we come to see in the end the psychologist works for Mona. The friendly family which takes him in can be seen on the Mona poster in her house. The only real and true, positive, humanly beautiful feeling he has experienced, Elaine, is working for his mother. Very Truman show. </p><p>He is being closely watched at all times. Mona dictates his life, she has a lingering presence at all times. Not only his life, but his sexuality as well. Beau's gigantic virgin ballsac is due to a fear created by Mona.</p><p>During the animated travel story scene, which was done so as to show the only truly imaginary part of the film we can see Beau breaking off a chain before he goes on his journey. That could be the symbolic chain which keeps him attached to his mother. Funnily enough the chandelier which falls on Mona also is connected via a chain to the ceiling. Even after meeting his sons at the end of the sequence he comes once again to the realisation that he cannot bear children due to the constraints of his mother. Even in his imagination the weight of his mother crushes him down. </p><p>Beau is broken and that frailness and the subsequent anxiety cannot make him not afraid. Even after meeting the nice family, beau cannot trust that that is real.</p><p>One parallel with the nice family is the "Hero" maniac soldier. This could be a good example of how the US treats their soldiers. Labels them as heroes, but strips their sanity and leaves them alone, unless there is a nice family to take them in. Ironically this soldier could be the one that has killed Nathan, as it was implied he was shooting at dead enemies and friendly soldiers when he was found.</p><p>I cannot draw any conclusion on the giant penis. I only understand that it's a penis as that's the only thing that his father represents.</p><p>Mona's mother not showing her any love, Mona suffocating Beau, this form of generational trauma is with us after we are born. After cutting our embelical cord we are still attached to out mothers.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

Both characters try to help a younger person who is in need of help. They help so that they can somehow achieve inner peace. Their past is a burdon, it's a heavy load which has changed them and it has basically created a new person within them.</p><p>On the Card Counter. We have the main protagonist who seems like a martyr. He carries the pain of his past and somewhat carries the pain of his associates from the past. On the other hand we have the major who is not taking responsibility. The two characters are starkly contrasted despite sharing an experience. </p><p>Lucky Lady is the one who is going to give PFC Tillich hope, a salvation as well as helping the young kid. The kid in turn will break the chain of violence. </p><p>However, good endings no matter how close in sight are a rarity and things don't go according to plan.</p><p>Nevertheless there is a silver lining and Paul Schroeder gives a glimpse of hope in the final scene.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

The story has this power to always keep the audience at their fingertips. However a constant in every story told, this one has a bit too much power, to disregard your beliefs in seconds and play in any way possible by saying this is not reality.</p><p>Would have preferred something a bit more realistic, tame. </p><p>However, the film still has viewing quality somewhat. Keeps you interested somewhat.</p><p>I expected so much more from this, but i guess Afflect continues to do one for them (Air) and one for him(Hypnotic)</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>

The cast, the story, the directional style and choppy editing style. A lof of the discussions stayed with me after watching. How unique are we? How much are we as personalities based on the media we consume? Are our ideas, really ours? Why do we negatively perceive older people as a society, how afraid are we of aging, getting old?</p><p>Everytime Kaufman releases a film he gets the idea right, despite it's vastness.</p> ]]></description> <dc:creator>art3xias</dc:creator> </item>
