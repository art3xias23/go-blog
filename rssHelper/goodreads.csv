A master of poetry places his deep knowledge and understanding of religion, literature, politics and human psychology behind the curtains of skilfully crafted passages.<br/><br/>We can all place ourselves in Dante's shoes. Since our divine intellect is easily corruptible by our senses we can all find ourselves in the dark forrest searching for the rightful path. <br/><br/>Dante chose Virgil as his guide as Virgil already envisioned a trip through hell via Aeneas in the Aeneid.<br/><br/>Terrible monsters and guardians such as Minos, Crete's king, Cerbereustry, Charon and others, try to stop their trip, but Virgil repremands them by signaling that Dante's path has been granted a stamp of approval by the ""One who wills"". <br/><br/>Caught me by surprise that non-Christians are on the first circle of hell, however appreciated the fact people such as Socrates are able to live the afterlife they envisioned during their lifetime.<br/><br/>Some symbolical pairings or sin and scene made a lasting impression on me. <br/> <br/><br/>Lustful on circle 2 are brown around by wind ad they don't have control over their behaviour.<br/><br/>The gluttonous on circle 3 live in horrid conditions as a pig<br/><br/>The wrathful on level 4 who didn't express wrath and kept it to themselves are drowning in the Styx with no one hearing what they are trying to convey underwater. <br/><br/>The sodomites on level 7 live in rain of fire and scorching land. Rain is supposed to stimulate the fertile soil produce vegetation. As sodomy does not produce offsprings, the same goes for the rain of fire and scorching earth. <br/><br/>In general, I enjoyed the way spirits are punished. With the opposite of what they tried to achieve on earth. I loved how Dante despite feeling pity at the start, progressively grew more disdainful of sin and stopped pitting the spirits. <br/><br/>I loved when right before the two poets descend to the ninth circle they see all the chained Giants. The first giant is called Nimrod, he built the tower of Babel and is talking gibberish. Virgil repremands him and tells him he is a dimwit. Found that incredibly funny.",,,1,0

I would find a friend who has a firm and order something, run it through the company and get back tax. (Depends on your location) <br/><br/>- Diversify your investments(Stocks, Bonds, Crypto) <br/><br/>- Start thinking about your pension<br/><br/>- Explore the idea of owning a business. <br/><br/>- Keep your emotions separate. Keep calm. <br/><br/>- All in all this book teaches you about what your mindset should be and I believe its a great book for a highscooler. <br/><br/>DISLIKES<br/><br/>- However, I disliked how he says MLM are a good thing and you should strive for it, despite me knowing some people who are highly successful at it, but if its not for you, it's not for you. <br/><br/>- There is too much repetition of everything. <br/><br/>- After double checking not everything is a true representation of his experience. Some things are mentioned as real life experience, but are made up. <br/><br/>- Studies have shown that people who have a mid level jobs are happier than people who own a business. <br/><br/>- Money does definitely not bring you happiness, despite a psychologist once telling me that most people's depression and problems come from not having money. <br/><br/>- Robert failed in the financial business company world. He was living out his car before these series of books exploded. <br/><br/>- He was never poor, mom was a nurse, dad was an academic. <br/><br/>I would strongly advise to avoid buying his seminars, games and possibly other books.

The denial is at the core of our being. Its what lets us carry on after the realization of our fragile and Camuean absurd lives. That makes sense when we put that into the context of conflict. If we take religion for example. When we have 2 conflicting ideologies, people on both sides will try to argue that the other one is fake as the oposing view is a threat to their own ""Denial of Death"". So far so good. He carries on to explain how all of us have an ""immortality system"" which arises from our civilization. Any groups we join, any idea we start to believe in, this is what we believe will continue to work after we have died. In a way we help something continue after us. We are fighting for a higher cause. Nevertheless, all of that is a mask behind our unwillingness to confront death as something which awaits us. This is the mistake Becker tries to show us. He supports Kirkegard's explanation of the man who has truly accepted himself for the fragile and limited being which he is and has become content with that. Accept the absurd, live it, but do not confuse yourself that you have surpassed death. That denial is the reason for so much of the world's pain and misery. No wonder it leads to conflict. Becker does not provide a solution, but in the ideology of the Buddhista we can see that they follow Kirkegard's argument. 1.understand u suffer.<br/>2. One of the seasons for many people to suffer is the denial.<br/>3. The truth that we can free ourselves from it.<br/>4. The path which leads to the end of suffering.<br/><br/>In my own eyes we need to accept that there is no higher cause. We will eventually die and nothing matters in the grand scheme of things. We need to feel the anxiety, accept ourselves and battle the absurdity of it on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Becker suggest some sort of a ""faith"" towards the devine cosmic plan. In a way blind faith, which tells us that we need to accept the fact we will never be able to attain true meaning.<br/><br/>Let's get back to the calmity with which Becker wants us to attain the acceptance of death. He mentions Socrates when he is called up to court for corrupting the youth and how he irritates the jury by not being frightened by the consequences. I personally remembered ""The Man"" in Nicola Vaptsarov's ""The song about a man"" and Carlos Fuentes' ""The death of Artemio Cruz"". Both heroes were in the same predicament,but they courageously and calmy(Artemio) or smiling and accepting(The man) faced death.<br/><br/><br/>To be continued...",,,1,0
